              <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                <b>This is a course about communication.</b> The first step is for you to learn how to
                communicate a real-world problem and propose a feasible solution. The second step is to
                transform the real-world representation into diagrams and documentation that will allow
                your development team to clearly understand and coordinate on designing the solution.
                The third step is to implement the design and to verify through testing, that you indeed solved the real-world
                solved the real-world problem using the proposed solution.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will start by giving you the vocabulary and tools that are currently standard for Agile
                object-oriented design. It will be up to each of you to use the tools and vocabulary to
                improve your own personal development practices as well as create an effective team environment.
              </p>

              <h3 class="title">Learning Outcomes</h3>
                <p>At the end of this course you will:</p>
                  <ul><li>Be able to envision, design, develop, and deliver a full software product with a team.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Be able to describe and use design patterns in the design and development of your software.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Be able to design and iteratively develop software using a story-driven approach.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Gain valuable experience working cooperatively in a group with a common goal using a proven Agile software development methodology.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Be able to coherently describe the differences between various software development processes in use today.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Improve your confidence and ability to deliver a sophisticated technical presentation.</li></ul>
                  <ul><li>Be able to read and draw simple UML diagrams.</li></ul>

              <h3 class="title">Topics</h3>
                <p>In this course we will discuss the following topics</p>
                <ul><li>Software Development Processes (Waterfall, Scrum, XP, and other Agile approaches to software development)</li></ul>
                <ul><li>User Stories</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Software Testing</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Project Management</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Object Oriented Design Theory</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Use Cases</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Design Patterns</li></ul>
                <ul><li>UML</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Development Best Practices</li></ul>

              <h3 class="title">Grading</h3>
                <p>There are two major parts to an individual’s final grade: personal and group. The personal portion of your grade will
                  account for 51% of your final grade with the group portion accounting for 49%.</p>
                <p>There is no final exam in this course; the group project grade will be the final grade you receive. Enjoy finals week
                  and study hard for your other courses, as SD&amp;D will be over by then. This course will not be graded on a curve. The
                  grade you earn is the grade you will receive. While we make every effort to ensure fair and equitable grading, you may
                  dispute any grade directly with the instructor. The grade will be modified only if appropriate.</p>

Group project grades and presentation grades may be penalized for blatant disregard of these guidelines.</p><p id="b52443a0-9cc8-4d09-90f2-abb58e203247" class="">All group assignments are to be submitted via LMS (https://lms.rpi.edu/). Entitle your file with the name of your group, the name of the assignment, and the submission date. For example, the group WeRock should submit their Interim Release deliverables on June 14th by pushing the following file to the LMS site: WeRock-Interim-jun14.pdf.</p><p id="1e80ecbb-2f57-4dab-836f-ca70fcc66a69" class="">All communication with the instructor should be sent to sddteaminstructor@gmail.com. We strongly recommend that you CC any communication which is about the team or the team project to everyone in the group. We welcome any and all communication with us through
              email.</p>
